mdjson-latex
============

A script that turns [mdjson](https://github.com/blabber/mdjson) into a LaTeX
file, that typesets a timetable like running order.

Caveat
------
To fit everything on one page, the Newforces Stage had to be removed from the
running order.

Usage
-----

    python mdjson-latex.py
    pdflatex metaldays.tex
